## LinkShare: Community-based internet exploration

This web application is powered by a Ruby on Rails (API), React, and Semantic UI.

The concept-board for this project includes three things:

The now-gone Yahoo! Directory,
The frontpage of the internet: Reddit, and
Amazon product reviews
These three concepts are fused to produce a directory of the internet, with admin-curated sub-directories (i.e. ‘tags’) that are filled with links via user-generated content. These links are each shared through the construction of reviews that have qualitative and quantitative aspects (written content and numerical rating, respectively).

In the end, it is an attempt at ‘community-based internet exploration’, a concept I came up with to differentiate this idea from crawler-based search engines as a means to navigate the internet. The product is akin to having access to the locals and their opinions when it comes to experiencing a new country, as opposed to experiencing the country via conventional tours. At some point, after goin through the tourist-experience many times over, you may want to discover the hidden gems of the world wide web.
